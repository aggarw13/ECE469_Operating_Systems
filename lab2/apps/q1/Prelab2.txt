Questions for Prelab 2 

1) 32 Semaphores are available in DLX)S

2) 64 locks are available in DLXOS

3) 32 condition variables are available in DLXOS

4)	The following provides details on implementation od Sem_signal and Sem_wait operations 
	Sem_signal access the semaphore being requested by the currnt process, increments the variable count 	associated with the semaphore and awakens the first sleeping process in the sempahore's associated queue. The operation of Sem_signal is performed by disabling interrupts to avoid context switching.
	
	Sem_wait decrements the value of semaphore count, checks the updated status of the semaphore value being accessed and accordingly, changes state of the requesting process. If the sempahore count < 0, then the requesting process is added to the waiting queue of the semaphoe and is put to sleep. To ensure that no context swich takes place while accessing the semaphore handle, the method diasbles interrupts during the operation.

5) A Handle is a reference variable to the static semaphore associated with it. A data structure Sem has been declared in sync.h for a handle to a semaphore. A suer proram can access create a new semaphore by using the Sem_create(int) user trap method, which returns a new handle to the semaphore.
